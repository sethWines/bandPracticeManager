BAND MANAGER - APPLICATION RECREATION GUIDE
===========================================

VERSION: 1.0
CREATED: 2024
PURPOSE: Guide for recreating the Band Manager application from scratch

===========================================
OVERVIEW
===========================================

Band Manager is a complete song and setlist management system with two main components:
1. Song Manager (song-manager.html) - Main song database and organization tool
2. Setlist Manager (setlist-manager.html) - Tool for creating and managing performance setlists

The application uses localStorage for data persistence and operates entirely client-side (no backend required).

===========================================
CORE TECHNOLOGIES
===========================================

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS Variables for theming)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- localStorage API for data persistence
- Print API for setlist printing

===========================================
CUSTOM ICONS
===========================================

GUITAR ICON (used as favicon and in Song Manager title):
- SVG-based custom icon resembling a guitar
- Hollow circle (guitar body) with radius 4.5
- Vertical line from top of circle (guitar neck)
- Two horizontal lines crossing the neck (frets/strings)
- Used as favicon for both pages (data URI format)
- Appears next to "Song Manager" title with theme color and glow effect
- Color: uses theme's --primary-color
- **CLICKABLE**: Clicking this icon switches the background watermark to the guitar icon
- Has `cursor: pointer` and `onclick="switchWatermark('guitar')"` attributes
- Active state: opacity 1, Inactive state: opacity 0.5

DRUM ICON (used in Setlist Manager for band names and Song Manager title):
- SVG-based custom icon resembling a drumset
- Center bass/floor tom: circle (r=4.5) with vertical stand
- Left vertical stand extends down to bottom of drum
- Low tom line (horizontal) at top of bass drum
- Mid tom line reaching toward right
- Right cymbal stand (vertical line, no drum)
- Multiple horizontal lines representing cymbals at different heights
- Snare rim line on right side
- Width: 60px, Height: 60px in Song Manager title
- Width: 44px, Height: 24px in Setlist Manager cards
- ViewBox: 0 0 40 24
- Color: uses currentColor (inherits from parent text color) or var(--primary-color)
- Positioned before band name in setlist cards
- Appears to the right of "Song Manager" title with theme color and glow effect
- **CLICKABLE in Song Manager**: Clicking this icon switches the background watermark to the drum icon
- Has `cursor: pointer` and `onclick="switchWatermark('drum')"` attributes
- Active state: opacity 1, Inactive state: opacity 0.5

WATERMARK FEATURE (Song Manager Page):
- **Interactive Background Watermarks**: Users can toggle between guitar and drum watermarks
- **How to Toggle**: Click either the guitar icon (left) or drum icon (right) in the page title
- **Persistence**: Watermark preference saved in localStorage as 'watermark' (values: 'guitar' or 'drum')
- **Cross-Page Synchronization**: Setlist Manager automatically inherits the watermark choice from Song Manager
- **Favicon Synchronization**: Browser tab favicon changes to match the selected watermark (guitar or drum icon)
- **Visual Feedback**: Active watermark's icon shown at full opacity (1), inactive at 0.5 opacity (Song Manager only)
- **CSS Implementation**:
  - `body::before` - Guitar watermark (default, 15% opacity, white stroke)
  - `body::after` - Drum watermark (hidden by default, fades in when active)
  - `body.drum-watermark::before` - Fades out guitar watermark (opacity: 0)
  - `body.drum-watermark::after` - Fades in drum watermark (opacity: 1)
  - Both positioned: top 0%, right -20%, width/height 100%, z-index 0
  - Smooth transitions: `transition: opacity 0.3s ease`
- **JavaScript Functions (Song Manager)**:
  - `loadWatermark()` - Loads saved preference on page load, applies to watermark and favicon
  - `switchWatermark(type)` - Switches watermark and saves preference to localStorage, updates favicon
  - `updateIconStyles(activeType)` - Updates icon opacity to indicate active/inactive state
  - `updateFavicon(type)` - Dynamically changes the browser favicon to match watermark (guitar or drum)
- **JavaScript Functions (Setlist Manager)**:
  - `loadWatermark()` - Reads and applies watermark preference from localStorage (no toggle functionality), updates favicon
  - `updateFavicon(type)` - Dynamically changes the browser favicon to match watermark (guitar or drum)

DATA PERSISTENCE STRUCTURE
===========================================

localStorage Keys:

1. "bandSongs" - Array of song objects
   ```javascript
   [
     {
       artist: "Artist Name",
       song: "Song Title",
       album: "Album Name",
       link: "https://...",
       tuning: "Standard",
       bands: "Band Tag",
       key: "G",
       firstNote: "G",
       lastNote: "D",
       duration: "3:45"
     }
   ]
   ```

2. "setlists" - Array of setlist objects
   ```javascript
   [
     {
       name: "Summer Tour 2024",
       band: "The Rock Band",
       sets: [
         {
           name: "1st Set",
           songs: [ /* song objects copied from bandSongs */ ]
         },
         {
           name: "2nd Set",
           songs: [ /* song objects */ ]
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
   ```

3. "bandOrganizerTheme" - String (theme name)
   - Values: "grey", "red", "blue", "green", "purple", "cyan", "teal", "amber", "copper", "pink"

4. "watermark" - String (watermark preference)
   - Values: "guitar" (default), "drum"
   - Synchronized between Song Manager and Setlist Manager

5. "columnVisibility" - Object (column show/hide state)
   - Keys: column names (artist, song, album, link, tuning, bands, key, firstNote, lastNote, duration)
   - Values: true (visible) or false (hidden)
   - Actions column always visible (not in this object)

===========================================
IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
===========================================

1. DRAG-AND-DROP ORDERING:
   - Must track: draggedSetlistIndex, draggedSetIndex, draggedSongIndex
   - Calculate targetPosition BEFORE removing dragged item
   - Adjust targetPosition after removal if necessary
   - Reset all drag state variables to null after operation
   - Clean up CSS classes (.dragging, .drop-preview)
   - Re-render after save to prevent state issues

2. SELECT ALL WITH FILTERS:
   - Must only select currently filtered/visible songs
   - Create getFilteredSongs() helper function
   - Check filtered songs for checkbox state (indeterminate if partial)
   - Update count display to show filtered vs total

3. PRINT FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Use @media print rules for page breaks
   - page-break-after: always on .set-section
   - page-break-inside: avoid to prevent splitting
   - Inject theme colors dynamically into print styles
   - Open print window, write HTML, call window.print()

4. MULTI-WORD SEARCH:
   - Use regex to find quoted phrases: /"([^"]*)"/g
   - Treat quoted content as single search term
   - Split remaining (non-quoted) text by /\s+/ (whitespace)
   - Use Array.every() - all words/phrases must match
   - Each word/phrase matches if found in ANY field
   - Case-insensitive (toLowerCase())
   - Example: 'drop d "standard e"' searches for "drop" AND "d" AND the phrase "standard e"

5. COLUMN FILTERS:
   - Group filters by column name
   - Within same column: OR logic (match ANY value)
   - Between different columns: AND logic (match ALL columns)
   - Use exact matching (===) not partial (includes)
   - Example: Tuning="Drop D" OR "Drop C" AND Key="G"
   - Special (empty) value to filter for missing/blank fields
   - Filter suggestions always generated from full dataset (not filtered results)

5. RESPONSIVE TABLE:
   - overflow-x: auto on container
   - min-width on table
   - max-height: calc(100vh - Xpx) for vertical scroll
   - position: sticky on thead for fixed header
   - Column visibility: Use display: none on th/td elements based on columnVisibility state

6. GLASSMORPHISM & WATERMARKS:
   - Control panes: background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15), backdrop-filter: blur(10px)
   - Border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)
   - Watermark: body::before for guitar, body::after for drum
   - Both watermarks at 15% opacity, positioned identically
   - body.drum-watermark class toggles which is visible
   - Smooth opacity transitions (0.3s ease)

6. THEME SYNCHRONIZATION:
   - Both files read from same localStorage key ("bandOrganizerTheme")
   - Load theme on page load (window.onload)
   - Apply by setting data-theme attribute on <body>
   - Grey theme = no data-theme attribute (uses :root variables)

7. WATERMARK SYNCHRONIZATION:
   - Both files read from same localStorage key ("watermark")
   - Song Manager: Interactive toggle via clickable title icons
   - Setlist Manager: Passive - reads and applies preference only
   - Load watermark on page load (window.onload)
   - Apply by adding/removing 'drum-watermark' class on <body>
